### Hello, I'm Tyler! ðŸ‘‹ ðŸŒ±âš¡

I care about designing services that are easy to use and work for everyone. I live in Brooklyn, NY.

Lately, I've been making it easier for Veterans to access benefits and services from the [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs) with [Blue Tiger](https://www.bluetiger.digital/).

I used to work in the UK, at the [Royal National Institute for Deaf People](https://rnid.org.uk/), [With You](https://www.wearewithyou.org.uk/), [STBY](https://www.stby.eu/) and the [Design Against Crime Research Centre](https://designagainstcrime.com/).

I have over 6 years of experience in design strategy, user research, usability testing, prototyping, service design and workshop facilitation.
