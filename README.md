### Hello, I'm Tyler! ðŸ‘‹ ðŸŒ±âš¡

I'm a researcher and designer of public services.

Lately, I've been working on making it simpler and safer to login and access the [Department of Veterans Affairsâ€™](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team) services with [Blue Tiger](https://www.bluetiger.digital/).

I used to work in the United Kindom, with the [Royal National Institute for Deaf People](https://rnid.org.uk/), [With You](https://www.wearewithyou.org.uk/), [STBY](https://www.stby.eu/) and the [Design Against Crime Research Centre](https://designagainstcrime.com/).

I care about designing services that are easy to use and work for everyone. Let's [connect](https://tylergindraux.com/).
